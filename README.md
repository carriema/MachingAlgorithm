## Assignment
Write an application that will match testers based on a user search criteria. The search results should be ranked in order of experience. Experience is measured by the amount of bugs a tester filed for a given device. You can use any third party libraries, but be prepared to discuss why you decided to use it.  You may use any technology, but please have a browser based UI for the search and results.

### Search Criteria
Country: values should be collected from "tester.csv" and should also have an option for "ALL". User can select one or more countries. Multiple selections are treated as "OR".

Device: values should be collected from "devices.csv" and should also have an option for "ALL". User can select one or more devices. Multiple selections are treated as "OR".
